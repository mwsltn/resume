%% Personal Statement 
%%
I'm an experienced (10+ years) engineering manager, systems
architecht, technical lead and software engineer. I specialize in
greenfield development, innovation, microservice architectures and
online video distribution systems. I believe engineering is a
dicipline driven by making decisions based on data.

%%   impressions in record numbers and were the start of the funnel for more for
%%   than half of all new customers during the 2018 World Cup.}

%%   TvOS, Roku, Android, Chromecast, and FireTV. By creating tests with the same

%%   100,000 concurrent users in production}

%% \project{SCTE224 \& MIMS (Manual Ingest Mapping System)}{FuboTV had the first
%%   commercially available SCTE224 data system for integrating with the MCRs
%%   (master control rooms) of broadcast partners. Basically, this system allows
%%   broadcasters like Fox and NBC to define which stations (i.e. local Fox in NY
%%   is not the same channel, content, incorporation, etc. as the local Fox in
%%   Pittsburg) receive which video streams by seamlessly integrating into their
%%   current production workflows in real time. For broadcast partners that did not
%%   yet have this technology available, we created a manual system for our
%%   programming and content teams to use.}

%% \project{A New Architecture}{I was a principal architect helping to design a
%%   top-to-bottom web-stack built from well known open source solutions meant to
%%   replace an ailing custom codebase. The system we were replacing consisted of a
%%   database, web server, and an event dispatch/event handling mechanism -- all of
%%   which were custom built. The system was full of very ugly patches, leaky
%%   abstraction, and was difficult to modify. Switching to battle-tested open
%%   source solutions allowed us to eliminate 72\% of the current codebase without
%%   compromising any functionality. In addition, we decreased the number of AWS
%%   instances needed to run a complete stack by an order of magnitude. In order to
%%   migrate the data, raw data blobs from the custom database needed to be
%%   translated to a properly relational set of SQL records and tables. I was the
%%   sole engineer tasked with writing this migration utility. The biggest
%%   challenges were translating an object graph where logical equality was
%%   sufficient to object graphs where object equality was required, de-tabling
%%   almost four years of object-reference rot, and be performant enough to crunch
%%   just over 100GB of data in under twenty minutes}

%% \project{Umpire Strike Zone Visualizer}{The Innovation Group was asked to
%%   prototype a visualization tool allowing a user to compare the “average”
%%   strike-zone of any two major league umpires across an arbitrary dimension from
%%   a predefined set, i.e. the same the same player, or team, etc. The
%%   visualization showed a heat-map of an MxN grid representing a region larger
%%   than the strike zone. Cells in the grid where colored to show whether more
%%   pitches in that cell were balls or strikes, showing the derived strike zone as
%%   a gradient and the defined strike zone as a superimposed box}

%% \project{TV2016}{In order to understand how our product (a cable TV network)
%%   could be adapted to leverage at-home IP video distribution technologies, the
%%   Innovation Team was tasked with inventing the “cable box” for an IP-multicast
%%   based TV distribution network. The system consisted of an automated clipping
%%   and tagging framework that would cut up every single MLB game and episode of
%%   SportsCenter into each component play or segment and add most relevant
%%   metadata (i.e. what teams/people, what happens, etc.). The client displayed
%%   all this on a custom built iPad application that communicated with an Android
%%   app running on a GoogleTV allowing users to navigate through all the content
%%   (live) and choose where to watch it (iPad, any of several “cable boxes”/TVs).}

%% \project{MrEncoder / MrRest / NASAmatic}{I was the sole engineer implementing
%%   a production quality version of the custom HLS video server that powered
%%   TV2016 (above). This meant writing a Java HLS library capable of speaking all
%%   major versions of the HLS protocol and representing all the different metadata
%%   elements described by HLS (timing info, closed captions, etc.). This system
%%   was used to publish college sports clips by owning them through the process of
%%   ingestion (go from a satellite dish to something we can use), clipping (what
%%   part do I want?), tagging (who’s/what’s in it?), all the way to distribution
%%   (how do we get it to a CDN?). Using this system to clip and tag instead of
%%   expensive “edit seats” connected to a industry standard storage system
%%   (Quantel) dramatically increased the productivity of individuals: the
%%   “automatic” clipping capabilities were augmented to make the people
%%   responsible for clipping and tagging more accurate and more productive. In
%%   order to handle a special request from NASA, were asked to adapt this system
%%   to send SportsCenter, Around The Horn, and PTI, to the International Space
%%   Station}

%% \project{Semantic Databases}{I was the sole engineer trying to solve the
%%   problem: When one DB powers graphics systems, one DB powers espn.com, and one
%%   DB powers the statistical analysts, etc., and each database has its own unique
%%   ID for a common external entity (i.e. Michael Jordan had N different integer
%%   IDs across the company) , how can we tag content with entities in one system
%%   and understand them in the context another? In other words, I was tasked with
%%   figuring how to create a unique notion of identity across several data systems
%%   all describing the same world in slightly different ways.  I got as far as a
%%   proof-of-concept that could translate primary keys based on computing the
%%   similarity of “identity-facts” defined in terms of a common ontology about
%%   each entity in each database and doing a fuzzy-comparison.}
