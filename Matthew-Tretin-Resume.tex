%% Personal Statement 
%%
I'm an experienced (15+ years) engineering leader, systems architect,
and software engineer. I've been trusted in key roles from individual
contributor up to vice-president focusing mainly on going from ``zero
to one'' when building new software solutions, new teams, new
processes, and new culture. Most of my career has been spent
developing cloud based micro-service architectures to create
innovative video distribution platforms and user applications.
\\
\\
In both engineering and management I believe in data based decision
making by identifying key KPIs, formulating hypotheses, and adjusting
quickly based on an honest appraisal of the results. My experience at
the leadership level has yielded the best outcomes when teams are
empowered with the confidence and knowledge to make correct autonomous
decisions 80\% of the time while ensuring positive relationships exist
to keep everyone happy the other 20\% of the time.
\\
\\
I am also a passionate ArchLinux user and GNURadio enthusiast.
\\
\\
\textit{Seeking any and all roles with cool problems to work
  on. References available upon request.}

% I'm an experienced (15+ years) engineering leader from the VP
